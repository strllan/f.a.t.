      <h2>Our Story</h2>

      <p>
        At Community First Aid &amp; CPR Training, our mission is simple: to empower everyday people
        with the skills and confidence to save lives. Founded in Sydney, we started with one clear
        purpose &mdash; to make high-quality, practical first aid education accessible, affordable,
        and genuinely useful for everyone.
      </p>

      <br /><br />

      <p>
        With years of experience in healthcare, community services and education, our team saw a gap:
        many first aid courses were either too complicated, too expensive or not hands-on enough.
        We wanted to change that.
      </p>

      <br /><br />

      <p>
        Today, we are proud to support families, schools, childcare centres, workplaces and community
        groups across Sydney. Every student we teach becomes part of a safer community &mdash; and that
        is why we do what we do.
      </p>

      <br /><br />

      <p>
        At Community First Aid &amp; CPR Training, your confidence is our goal. We are here to help you
        be ready, stay calm and save lives when it matters most.

            environment where everyone can learn at their own pace and ask questions without feeling rushed.
